## professional self-assessment:
Due to a change in my circumstances, I found myself enrolled in the Computer Science program with a concentration in Software Engineering at SNHU. This program offers courses that emphasize the design and development of computer software, providing specialized math, science, and engineering skills needed for career success. It taught how to improve, secure and test code while analyzing software design patterns and systems architecture. Throughout the program I had my share of highs and lows. I shed both tears of frustration when things would not work as expected and tears of joy when I figured out a particularly challenging problem. It was with hard work, determination and dedication that I have come to my final term of the program. Looking back I am proud of what I have accomplished. With the knowledge that I have gained and the strength that I have shown I hope to create a better life not only for me, but for my kids as well.

There are many areas of the computer science program that have helped showcase my strengths and shape my professional goals and values such as collaborating in a team environment, communicating with stakeholders, software engineering, data structures and algorithms, databases, and security. Collaborating in a team environment through various avenues such as project work, presentations, and peer evaluations shows how to work effectively with a team, communicate ideas, and contribute to shared goals. Participating in peer review through weekly posts allows assessing the work of other students and receiving feedback on my own contributions, showcasing my ability to provide and receive constructive criticism. Code reviews, like the one done in CS 499 Capstone, allowed me to analyze and provide feedback on the code of my final project demonstrating my ability to collaborate and improve code quality. Finally delivering presentations on technical topics showcases my communication skills and ability to convey complex information clearly.
	
Through the practical application of communication skills with coursework and project contexts such as project-based learning, presenting solutions by explaining complex concepts to both technical and non-technical audiences, articulating ideas clearly, and clear and concise documentation which ensures project understanding showcases my strengths in communicating with stakeholders. 

My strengths in software engineering are shown through foundational knowledge and practical experience. Foundational knowledge encompasses core computer concepts such as fundamental principles like algorithms, programming skills like Python, Java, and C++, and software development methodologies like Agile and Scrum which are crucial for understanding and participating in the software development life cycle. Practical experience was gained through hands-on projects which allowed me to apply knowledge and develop software from concept to completion and showcase my ability to design, develop, test, and maintain software. Through software engineering I was able to develop essential skills like problem solving, critical thinking, teamwork and communication, and adaptability. It provided a strong theoretical foundation, practical hands-on experience, and opportunities to develop essential technical and soft skills.

My strengths in data structures and algorithms are highlighted through structured curriculum, practical applications, and assessment methods. Course work and curriculum includes dedicated courses, in depth study, emphasis on fundamentals, and practical application. Through assessment and evaluation I developed problem solving skills, analysis of time and space complexity, and implementation and revaluation. By incorporating these elements into the curriculum and assessment methods I gained a solid foundation in data structures and algorithms.

My knowledge of databases was obtained through various avenues. Core database courses taught fundamental concepts like data models, schemas, queries, indexing, and transactions. Database programming courses focused on database programming languages like SQL and NoSQL databases such as MySQL and MongoDB showcasing my ability to interact with and manipulate data. Database design and implementation projects allowed me to design, implement, and optimize databases for specific applications or systems clearly demonstrating my practical skills and abilities to build robust and scalable database solutions. 

Courses in security such as Secure Coding and Software Security provide foundational knowledge such as understanding systems and networks, internet security, and application security. Being able to understand systems and networks provides a strong foundation in how computers and systems operate. Internet security provided knowledge of vulnerabilities, how cyber criminals exploit weaknesses, and how to prevent attacks like malware and phishing. Application security allowed me to understand how applications are built, used, and secured covering aspects like application development and its security implications. 
For my capstone project I used an artifact from IT 145 Foundation in Application Development to create a full stack application project that integrates software engineering and design principles with data structures and algorithms and databases to build a complete, functional application. Full stack encompasses both the front end (user interface) and back end (server side logic, database interactions) components of a web application. Understanding algorithms and data structures is crucial for efficient back end development and optimizing application performance, while database knowledge is essential for managing  and storing application data. 
Software engineering and design involves the entire software development life cycle from initial design to deployment and maintenance. Software principles guide the overall structure and organization of the project. Algorithms and data structures are fundamental for efficient back end logic performance optimization. Choosing the right data structure and algorithms can significantly improve application performance. Full stack applications need to understand how to design and interact with databases to store and retrieve application data, create database schemas, write queries, and manage data effectively integrating the database with the front end and back end components of the application. A full stack application project requires a comprehensive understanding of both front end and back end technologies and the ability to apply software engineering principles, algorithms and data structures, and database knowledge to build a complete, functional and efficient application.



## code review:  
Code review is an assessment of code to ensure that it meets specific goals. It is a good way to improve yourself as a programmer through learning and teaching other about a new language feature, changes in design, new techniques, and open-souce projects.

Best practices of code review:  
- take your time
- set goals
- use checklists
- establish a process for fixing defects found

Course Outcomes: #2
